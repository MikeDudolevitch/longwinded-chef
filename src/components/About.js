            <p id="about-p">Welcome to my site! My name is Mike, and I love combining my passion for food with my passion for rambling stories vaguely related to the recipes I share, so that when you actually want to find out how to cook something you have to sift through my narcissism and self-importance to get there! Like this one time- I was maybe 13 or 14 years old. And my friend Timmy, who was kind of weird, asked me to watch his pet turtle for the weekend. I think his family was going to Branson Missiouri as his parents bought a timeshare there and had it for a week. I only recently realized that timeshares are a scam where you don't have much control over a property but you're on the hook for taxes and maintenance with little payoff, but I guess that's what his parents had. So he asks me to put his food in his (I can't remember if it was a boy or a girl) turtle's tank twice a day, which meant I would have to walk the 3 blocks over to his house twice a day. I could have stayed over there, but my mom would worry, plus I had better video games than him, which is why he would mostly come to my house to play them. But one of the days that he was away I went over there and I saw that the 2 bananas left were starting to turn black and would go bad, plus there was only 3 slices of bread left in a bag so I decided to help myself to a peanut butter and banana sandwich. It always takes me back </p>
